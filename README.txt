Thank You for giving me this oppurtunity to complete this assignment

I completed as Instructed.

I completed the whole project using react with ant design and scss.

Some of the things I did -

1) I made this project using vite, not create react app. So to start the project we should run------ npm run dev.


2) As the invoice page is the main page given in the figma file I made invoice page the default page instead of the dashboard page.


3) And other components are blank, but we could use it in future.

4) used Mixins and variables in SCSS to organize the file more properly

5) I didnt made the toggle menu function as it was not mentioned but I can do it if said so.


THANK YOU :)
